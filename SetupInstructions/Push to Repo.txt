*NOTE: BEFORE EVEN EDITING CODE, PULL FROM REPO*
-Make sure your code is up-to-date

	git pull https://github.com/MBogert/UniBake

-If it's not letting you pull, chances are that you made a change in the repo on your laptop before pulling. Here's the workaround

	git pull https://github.com/MBogert/UniBake --allow-unrelated-histories

-It'll pull, despite changes, but be cautious about this, because maybe you want the repo code as opposed to whatever code you may have. Just remember to pull before editing/adding anything.



How to push changes to GitHub

1. Add files you want to make changes to.

	git add <fileName>

	Do this for every file that you changed and want to push changes to

2. Commit the changes

	git commit -m <Message>

	This sets things up to be pushed. Be sure to provide a short message, explaining what changes you made (e.g. "Modified user login")

3. Push changes

	git push origin master

	It'll ask for authentication. Since it's on my account, here's the login info.

	UserName: MBogert
	Password: ensalada888lettuce
