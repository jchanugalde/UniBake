How to SetUp GitHub on your Laptops

Install GitBash (Pretty nice)

1. Make your repo directory

This is where the code will go on your laptop. Create a directory name 'UniBake', cd into that.

	git init

It is now a git repository.

2. Add the origin

	git remote add origin https://github.com/MBogert/UniBake

This is where the repo is stored on github, verify that this worked with this command.

	git remote -v

Make sure that the URL that comes up is the same one as above.

Now we can code! Don't forget to pull the current code on your repo before starting.

	git pull https://github.com/MBogert/UniBake
