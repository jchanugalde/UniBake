### Description
UPS CSCI455 (*Introduction to Databases*) student project.

### Executive Summary
Many first-year undergraduate students live in on-campus residential halls. This experience
affords students the opportunity to form communities and engage with their peers. While
most universities' Residence Life Department typically implements programs meant to aid
these endeavors, many group social interactions are student-driven.

Cooking, for instance, is a common social activity among first-year students. However, the
participants involved are determined by: (1) proximity (e.g. students on the same floor)
and (2) available ingredients (i.e. what ingredients the participants have collectively).

UniBake connects users (i.e. students) according to availability and a chosen recipe. Users:
  - choose a recipe they're interested in making
  - select the (required) ingredients they can contribute
  - select a timeframe they're available

Users are then shown potential matches based on compatibility (i.e availability, recipe preference,
and collective ingredients).

  them to baking recipes*
